# laravel-gui-installer

Well i wouldn't call it a laravel installer, because i could not dedicate enough time to integrate it and make it run out of the box so i will rather call it a simple php installer, for installing laravel script. it uses the same process as the easy installer from viserLab. So if you're familiar with viserlab then you're sure to understand how this works.

Am putting this up for personal use. So if you're downloading this be sure to modify to go along with what you need it for.

winks
